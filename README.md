# Discord CSS
Some themes I made for Better Discord. Still a WiP <br>
Probably the most detailed and attention focused theme on the internet. <br>
You can set your own image and colors.

<h3>How to get live updates to themes</h3>
<h5>Go to Custom CSS in the settings and paste this line of code in for the theme you want</h5> 
<h5>If you want to keep your custom background image and color scheme put the root part of the css into the custom CSS field. This starts at line 20 and ends at line 107. </h5>
